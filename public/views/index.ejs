            <h2>The ghost and the boy</h2>
          
            <p class="summary">
              Timmy was scared of everything. He didn't like trying new things. He was too nervous to speak up in class, join games, or even ride his bike without training wheels. “What if I fall? What if I mess up?” Timmy always asked. 
            </p>
            <p class="full-content" style="display: none;">
              One day, Timmy's family moved to a new house on Bravery Hill. The house was old, creaky, and surrounded by tall, whispering trees. It was the kind of place that made Timmy even more nervous.

              On his first night there, Timmy lay in bed, listening to the wind howl. Suddenly, he heard a soft voice.
              
              “Why so glum, young one?” the voice said.
              
              Timmy shot up, his heart pounding. In the corner of his room stood a glowing figure. It was a ghost! But the ghost wasn't scary at all. She was small, glowing faintly blue, with kind eyes and a warm smile.
              
              “Who are you?” Timmy whispered.
              
              “I'm Clara,” the ghost said. “I used to live here many, many years ago. I help kids who are scared. And you, my boy, seem to be scared of a lot.”
              
              Timmy's face turned red. “I just… don't think I'm good at anything,” he said. “I'm always too scared to try.”
              
              Clara smiled gently. “Let's change that. Tomorrow, we'll start small.”
              <br></br>
              The next morning, Clara was waiting by the door when Timmy woke up. “What's the first thing you're afraid of?” she asked.

              Timmy thought for a moment. “Riding my bike without training wheels,” he admitted.

                “Perfect,” Clara said. She floated outside, glowing in the morning sun.

                Timmy wobbled onto his bike as Clara floated beside him. “If you fall, I'll catch you," she said.

              Timmy took a deep breath. He pushed off, his legs shaking. At first, the bike wobbled. Then it steadied. Timmy was riding!

              “Look at me!” he yelled, a big grin on his face.

              “You did it all on your own,” Clara said, beaming. “Now, what's next?”
              <br></br>

              Over the next few days, Clara helped Timmy face more fears. She stood by his side when he raised his hand in class, whispering, “You’ve got this.” She cheered quietly when he joined a soccer game during recess.

                 One evening, Clara asked, “What's the one thing you're most scared of?”

                Timmy frowned. “Talking to people I don't know,” he said.

                Clara nodded. “Tomorrow, let's try. Just say hello to someone new. That's it.”

                The next day, Timmy saw a boy playing alone at lunch. His stomach churned, but he remembered Clara's words.

                 “Hi, I'm Timmy,” he said.

                The boy smiled. “I'm Jake. Want to play?”

                Timmy's heart soared.
                <br></br>
                That night, Clara appeared one last time.

                 “Timmy,” she said, “you don't need me anymore. You've found your bravery.”

                Timmy felt a lump in his throat. “Thank you, Clara,” he whispered.

                She smiled. “You've always had it in you. Goodbye, my brave friend.”

                   And with that, Clara faded away, leaving Timmy with a new sense of confidence—and a heart full of courage.</p>

            <h2>Rapunzel</h2>
            <p class="summary">

              A beautiful princess is trapped in a tower by a wicked witch. A brave prince, drawn by her enchanting voice, sets out to rescue her. But their journey is filled with twists and turns, and their love is put to the ultimate test.
            </p>
            <p class="full-content" style="display: none;">
            Once upon a time, a couple lived in a small stone hut on a hill near the woods. They wished for a child but were unsure if they'd be good parents. Behind their house was a window overlooking a beautiful garden filled with Rapunzel plants. The garden belonged to a powerful witch, and no one dared to enter it.   
           
            <br></br>
            One day, the woman gazed longingly at the Rapunzel and fell ill, craving it desperately. “I must have some, or I'll die,” she said to her husband. Out of love, the man snuck into the garden to steal the plant. The witch caught him and demanded, “How dare you steal my Rapunzel? You will pay for this!”
              <br></br>
            When their daughter was born, the witch took her away. She named her Rapunzel and raised her in a tall, doorless tower deep in the forest. Rapunzel grew into a beautiful girl with long golden hair. To visit her, the witch would call, “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let your hair down!”

              One day, a prince heard Rapunzel singing from the tower. Enchanted by her voice, he returned daily to listen. He saw the witch climb the tower using Rapunzel's hair and decided to try himself. Calling out the same words, he climbed up and met Rapunzel.
              <br></br>
              At first, Rapunzel was startled, having never seen a man before. But the prince explained he was drawn by her voice and soon asked her to marry him. Rapunzel agreed and devised a plan: the prince would bring silk each visit so she could weave a ladder and escape with him.
              <br></br>
              “You'll never see Rapunzel again!” the witch sneered. Distraught, the prince stumbled back and fell from the tower. Though he survived, thorns blinded him.

                For years, the prince wandered the forest, living in sorrow. One day, he stumbled into the desert where Rapunzel had been banished. Hearing her familiar voice, he followed it and finally found her. Overjoyed, Rapunzel embraced him. As her tears fell onto his eyes, his sight was miraculously restored.
                
                The prince and Rapunzel returned to his kingdom with their twin children. They lived happily ever after, their love proving stronger than any spell.
